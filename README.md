# About PSC
The Pokémon Standards Consortium (PSC) is a collaboration between various stakeholders in the Pokémon community to agree upon common formats to communicate information.

# Process
The process for PSC standards documents is loosely based on processes used by IETF, W3C, and ISO, as well as common software release life cycles.

There are five stages of a PSC standards document:
## Proposal
A Proposal can be created by anyone, regardless of membership in PSC.
## Early Draft
Once a Proposal gets sponsored by a member and seconded by another member (from a different organization if the member is a representative), an Early Draft is created. A PSC ID is assigned at this point, to allow for easy tracking.
## Working Draft
Once an Early Draft reaches a point where the sponsor feels that the document is mostly complete, it becomes a Working Draft. Working Drafts are to be reviewed by all members to determine if any changes need to be made.
## Publication Candidate
On a biweekly basis, the list of Working Drafts will be reviewed by the Consortium, and each will be put up for vote to move to Publication Candidate. Two days (48 hours) will be given to vote, after which the decision will be made based on a plurality of voting members. Once a Publication Candidate, members are encouraged to communicate the documents to their organizations for review.
## Finalized Standard
On a biweekly basis, the list of Finalized Standards will be reviewed by the Consortium, and each will be put up for vote to move to Finalized Standard. Seven days (168 hours) will be given to vote, after which the decision will be made based on a plurality of voting members. Once a Finalized Standard, the document is considered finished. Minor amendments may be made afterwards, starting as late in the process as Working Drafts.

# GitHub structure
## standards
The standards repository is where all standards documents are stored. Final documents are published in the final branch, whereas documents at all working stages are in the drafts branch.
## meta
The meta repository contains information on the Pokémon Standards Consortium itself, including the procedure for creating a standards document, a list of members, etc.

# Members
