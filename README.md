# About PSC
The mission of the Pokémon Standards Consortium is to ensure the interoperability of information related to the Pokémon franchise between organizations by developing well-defined and clear methods. This is a semi-formal, community-driven initiative that will allow for more data portability across projects and organizations, working directly with those who hope to benefit from the Consortium's efforts to ensure rigid standards.

# Standards process
The process for PSC standards documents is loosely based on processes used by IETF, W3C, and ISO, as well as common software release life cycles.

There are five stages of a PSC standards document:
## Proposal
A Proposal can be created by anyone, regardless of membership in PSC.
## Early Draft
Once a Proposal gets sponsored by a member and seconded by another member (from a different organization if the member is a representative), an Early Draft is created. A PSC ID is assigned at this point, to allow for easy tracking.
## Working Draft
Once an Early Draft reaches a point where the sponsor feels that the document is mostly complete, it becomes a Working Draft. Working Drafts are to be reviewed by all members to determine if any changes need to be made.
## Publication Candidate
On a biweekly basis, the list of Working Drafts will be reviewed by the Consortium, and each will be put up for vote to move to Publication Candidate. Two days (48 hours) will be given to vote, after which the decision will be made based on a plurality of voting members. Once a Publication Candidate, members are encouraged to communicate the documents to their organizations for review.
## Finalized Standard
On a biweekly basis, the list of Finalized Standards will be reviewed by the Consortium, and each will be put up for vote to move to Finalized Standard. Seven days (168 hours) will be given to vote, after which the decision will be made based on a plurality of voting members. Once a Finalized Standard, the document is considered finished and ready for use. Minor amendments may be proposed afterwards, starting as late in the process as Working Drafts (without assigning a new PSC ID).

# GitHub structure
## standards
The standards repository is where all standards documents are stored. Final documents are published in the final branch, whereas documents at all working stages are in the drafts branch. Where applicable, this repository also includes formed JSON versions of the standards for ease of use.
## meta
The meta repository contains information on the Pokémon Standards Consortium itself, including the procedure for creating a standards document, a list of members, etc.

# Membership
Organizations and individuals can become members of PSC to provide input throughout the standards process. You do not need to be a member to participate in discussion, create a Proposal, or (most importantly) utilize the standards documents. Voting and sponsoring/seconding a Proposal are the primary rights granted to members.
## List of members
The following are members of the Pokémon Standards Consortium. Members may be representatives of an organization or unaffiliated.
### Board members
The following are members of the PSC Management Board. The Board has few responsibilities, as the majority of PSC operations are driven by all members. Board responsibilities include moderation of the PSC Discord, administration of the GitHub, and the processing of member applications.
